    <p>Hello this is Wred the maker of this website. I am a Computer Programmer and I am learning Electrical Engineering. This is the first of many blog posts about what I am working on and so on. I want to create a a IDE for Computer Programming and for Electrical Engineering so you can write code for a piece of hardware. My first ideas/projects include a a video game console for my mom that plays the pac-man game I coded and a computer(wouldn't it be cool to have your very own computer) but let me know what you think I will be adding some more features to Blog section soon.</p>
