    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
  

      So how did I get to where I am today? Well it all started when I was looking for something interesting to learn and I was asking my mom what she did and she said she tried to learn computer programming(the keyword being tried). So we started researching the best coding languages to learn and we found…. PYTHON. Python is an open source language that is perfect for beginners and so I downloaded it and began one of the best things that has ever happened to me (besides my dog Ember). As I began to get better I also created longer and better code and here is an example. Take a look a my Pac-man game I made it a thousand and two hundred twenty two lines of code. I also am learning Javascript, HTML, CSS and tailwind CSS for creating this website. I want to create multiple websites and apps (Software) so here are a few. Prodicode, a AI assisted IDE with integrated UI/UX design software. And my newest idea a IDE that has everything you need to write code for your electrical engineering. And that’s a good seg-way to what I do when I am older. I want to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering in college. And I want to learn Computer Science outside of college. The tools I use are VS Code for Coding and Elegoo Mega 2560 Starter Kit. I work towards making the best websites, software, hardware possible. Now why is technology so interesting to me? Well tech lets me engineering what I can imagine. It lets me feel responsible for something cool. Now I want to discuss something really important to me and, and that’s being autistic. Now a lot of people think autism is bad (it does have some frustrations) but there is a lot of good to. Like me being able to be really good at something (like coding/programming). So overall being autistic has been and dream not a dread. What sets me apart from other coders? What truly sets me apart is that I want to build. I want to engineer. How do I learn the best, well I learn by trying building trying building etc.
