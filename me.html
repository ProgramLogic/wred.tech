    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>So how did I get to where I am today? Well it all started when I was looking for something interesting to learn and I was asking my mom what she did and she said she tried to learn computer programming(the keyword being tried). So we started researching the best coding languages to learn and we found…. PYTHON. Python is an open source language that is perfect for beginners and so I downloaded it and began one of the best things that has ever happened to me (besides my dog Ember). I also am learning Javascript, HTML, CSS and tailwind CSS for creating this website. I want to create multiple websites and apps (Software) so here are a few. Prodicode, a AI assisted IDE with integrated UI/UX design software. And my newest idea a IDE that has everything you need to write code for your electrical engineering. And that’s a good segway to what I do when I am older. I want to study Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering in college. And I want to learn Computer Science outside of college. </p>
